        "5.Used tail() function for displaying last five rows and columns of the dataframe by default.\n",

This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.\n"

        "\n",
        "(1) Around 60% bookings are for City hotel and 40% bookings are for Resort hotel, therefore City Hotel is busier than Resort hotel. Also the overall adr of City hotel is slightly higher than Resort hotel.\n",

        "(2) Mostly guests stay for less than 5 days in hotel and for longer stays Resort hotel is preferred.\n",

        "(3) Both hotels have significantly higher booking cancellation rates and very few guests less than 3 % return for another booking in City hotel. 5% guests return for stay in Resort hotel.\n",
        "\n",
        "(4) Most of the guests came from european countries, with most of guests coming from Portugal.\n",
        "\n",
        "(5) Guests use different channels for making bookings out of which most preferred way is TA/TO.\n",
        "\n",
        "(6) For hotels higher adr deals come via GDS channel, so hotels should increase their popularity on this channel.\n",
        "\n",
        "(7) Not getting same room as reserved, longer lead time and waiting time do not affect cancellation of bookings. Although different room allotment do lowers the adr.\n",
        "\n",
        "(8)BB (bed and breakfast) is the most prefered type of meal in hotel.\n",
        "\n",
        "(9)For customers, generally the longer stays (more than 15 days) can result in better deals in terms of low adr.\n",
